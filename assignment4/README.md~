#Yet to be made
rpc_test.go test cases takes about 350s to run on my computer

I have changed nclients value form 500 to 50 in `TestRPC_ConcurrentWrites()` since it was taking too much time.

Also I have changed `TestRPC_ConcurrentCas(t *testing.T)`
```
	nclients := 3 //from #100 to 3
	niters := 2   //from #10 to 2
	if !(m.Kind == 'C' && strings.HasSuffix(string(m.Contents), " 1")) {
```

Thank you Sriram Sir.
